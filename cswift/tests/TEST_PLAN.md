# Comprehensive Test Plan for CSwift

## Current State
The existing tests are mostly "smoke tests" that only verify the code doesn't crash. They lack:
- Actual functionality verification
- Edge case testing
- Error condition testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration testing

## Test Categories Needed

### 1. ByteBuffer Tests
Current coverage: Basic operations only

**Missing Tests:**
- [ ] Capacity expansion behavior
- [ ] Read/write boundary conditions
- [ ] Zero-copy write verification (actually verify no copies!)
- [ ] Thread safety tests
- [ ] Memory leak tests
- [ ] Large data handling (>1MB, >100MB)
- [ ] Read/write index management
- [ ] Slice operations
- [ ] Endianness handling

### 2. EmbeddedChannel Tests
Current coverage: Just creation and nullptr checks

**Missing Tests:**
- [ ] Actual data flow through channel
- [ ] Pipeline handler chain testing
- [ ] Error propagation
- [ ] Channel state transitions
- [ ] Backpressure handling
- [ ] Close/shutdown behavior
- [ ] Event firing and handling
- [ ] Inbound/outbound data transformation

### 3. EventLoopGroup Tests
Current coverage: Basic task execution

**Missing Tests:**
- [ ] Multi-threaded task distribution
- [ ] Task scheduling accuracy
- [ ] Future composition
- [ ] Promise fulfillment
- [ ] Graceful shutdown under load
- [ ] Task cancellation
- [ ] Error handling in tasks
- [ ] EventLoop selection strategy
- [ ] Performance under high load

### 4. TSConnectionChannel Tests (Not implemented)
**Required Tests:**
- [ ] TCP connection establishment
- [ ] Data transmission/reception
- [ ] Connection failure handling
- [ ] Timeout behavior
- [ ] TLS/SSL support
- [ ] Reconnection logic
- [ ] Network error simulation
- [ ] Bandwidth throttling

### 5. ChannelPipeline Tests (Not implemented)
**Required Tests:**
- [ ] Handler addition/removal
- [ ] Handler ordering
- [ ] Data transformation chains
- [ ] Error handler behavior
- [ ] Dynamic pipeline modification
- [ ] Context propagation

### 6. Metal/MPS Tests (Not implemented)
**Required Tests:**
- [ ] Buffer creation and management
- [ ] Compute shader execution
- [ ] Graph compilation
- [ ] Tensor operations
- [ ] Memory synchronization
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Multi-GPU handling

### 7. Integration Tests
**Required Tests:**
- [ ] Full network echo server/client
- [ ] Stress test with 1000+ connections
- [ ] Memory pressure tests
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Swift-C++ boundary testing
- [ ] Crash recovery

## Test Utilities Needed

1. **Test Helpers**
   - Network test server
   - Data generators
   - Performance measurement tools
   - Memory leak detector integration

2. **Mock Objects**
   - Mock event loops
   - Mock channels
   - Mock handlers

3. **Benchmarks**
   - Throughput tests
   - Latency tests
   - Memory usage tests
   - CPU usage tests

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Core functionality)
   - ByteBuffer comprehensive tests
   - EventLoopGroup comprehensive tests
   - Basic TSConnectionChannel tests

2. **Medium Priority** (Extended functionality)
   - EmbeddedChannel full tests
   - ChannelPipeline tests
   - Integration tests

3. **Low Priority** (Platform-specific)
   - Metal/MPS tests
   - CoreML tests
   - Cross-platform tests

## Success Criteria

Each test should:
1. Have clear assertions (not just "doesn't crash")
2. Test both success and failure paths
3. Include edge cases
4. Be deterministic and repeatable
5. Run quickly (<100ms per test)
6. Have descriptive names and comments
